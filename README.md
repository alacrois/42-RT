This is a group project about Raytracing.

The goal is to represent a 3D scene with basic shapes (described here in a .json file given as input) using raytracing. This was a group project (4 students), my part was handling the maths and calculations.

You need to have GTK 3 installed to compile.

Scene "exemple1.json" :
![Alt text](screens/exemple1.png?raw=true "exemple1.json")
