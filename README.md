This is a group project about Raytracing.

The goal is to represent a 3D scene with simple shapes (described here in a .json file given as input) using raytracing. This was a group project (4 students), my part was handling the maths and calculations.

The program handles a variety of basic shapes (sphere, cylinder, cone, cube, plane, tetrahedron...), transparency, reflexions and different lightsources. There is also a basic parser for .obj files.

You need to have GTK 3 installed to compile.

Scene "exemple1.json" :
